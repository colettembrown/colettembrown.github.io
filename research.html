                  <p> Wildfires in the Arctic are increasing in the number of acres burned, duration, and severity, causing large uncertainties of the region as a source or a sink of greenhouse gasses. This uncertainty is partially due to unclear impacts of fire on vegetation at a large scale, particularly whether and how vegetation recovers. Vegetation recovery is spatially heterogeneous due to changes in soil hydrothermal conditions, nutrient availability, and vegetation demographic dynamics. Quantifying post-fire recovery at a large scale thereby requires high-resolution observations and constraints from ground truth. While previous studies have used satellite imagery and machine learning to characterize land cover change in Arctic systems, they were not specifically designed to quantify post-fire recovery. Thus robust quantification of vegetation recovery after tundra fires is still missing. Here, taking the largest recorded tundra fire–the 2007 Anaktuvuk River Fire in northern Alaska–as a case study, we use satellite imagery harmonized across Landsat 5, 7, 8 (OLI and ETM+) and a random forest model to generate annual maps of plant functional types (PFTs) at a 30 m resolution during 2007-2020.  The model is constrained by ground truth data of PFT from recurring vegetation surveys during 2007-2017 collected by the Bureau of Land Management. Our results show an overall accuracy of 90%, and a 94% precision for evergreen and deciduous sub-shrub classes, with high precision and recall for every PFT. We demonstrate that not only greenness but all harmonized Landsat bands are important predictors of PFT distribution. Our model predicts that in the region we analyzed, there is a persistent increase in the relative cover of subshrub deciduous and graminoid PFTs  for at least 11 years post-fire, and the percent cover of both PFTs was higher inside of the burned area than outside of the burned area over the same time period. The maps produced here are among the first quantifying decadal vegetation recovery trajectories at a high spatial resolution, which can be used in future work to identify greening trends, vegetation communities, and the expanding shrub line. Our findings on vegetation composition change post-fire will contribute to better estimation of carbon budgets under future fire regimes in the Arctic.
