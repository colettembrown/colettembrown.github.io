                  <p> Wildfires in the Arctic are increasing in the number of acres burned, duration, and severity, causing large uncertainties of the region as a source or a sink of greenhouse gasses. This uncertainty is partially due to unclear impacts of fire on vegetation at a large scale, particularly whether and how vegetation recovers. Vegetation recovery is spatially heterogeneous due to changes in soil hydrothermal conditions, nutrient availability, and vegetation demographic dynamics. </p>
                <p>Quantifying post-fire recovery at a large scale thereby requires high-resolution observations and constraints from ground truth. While previous studies have used satellite imagery and machine learning to characterize land cover change in Arctic systems, they were not specifically designed to quantify post-fire recovery. Thus robust quantification of vegetation recovery after tundra fires is still missing. </p>
                <p>With Margaret Torn, Yanlan Liu, and Amy Breen, we took the largest recorded tundra fire–the 2007 Anaktuvuk River Fire in northern Alaska–as a case study, we use satellite imagery harmonized across Landsat 5, 7, 8 (OLI and ETM+) and a random forest model to generate annual maps of plant functional types (PFTs) at a 30 m resolution during 2007-2020. The model is constrained by ground truth data of PFT from recurring vegetation surveys during 2007-2017 collected by the Bureau of Land Management. </p>
